# Smoke Stream

Modified from [Colorful Fluid Animation](https://github.com/Delivator/WebGL-Fluid-Simulation).

## Development
Open `index_test.html` in Edge (couldn't get it to work in Chrome due to security settings).
This allows you to load an .mp3 file for testing.
You can make changes to `script.js` on the fly:
- F12 to access dev tools
- go to Sources and find `script.js`
- make edits and save (this only saves over the copy in the browser cache, not your local version)
